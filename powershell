Powershell.exe is a wrapper for a .dll called system.management.automation.dll
system.management.automation.dll
powershell is based on the .net framework within microsoft
everything is processed through system.management.automation.dll and is based on C#
Powershell is on Linux, macOS, and windows
We will only be using powershell on windows devices
verb noun, tab complete, F8 will run whatever you have highlighted
There's many ways to skin a cat in powershell
Powershell itself runs in itself but can use external applications
case insensitive even in linux, cmdlet then parameters with arguments

Get-Help
Update-Help
THE PRETEST IS A LOT EASIER THAN THE TEST ouch
Get-Help Get-Command gives you help on get-command, it goes a lot more in depth and you can get
help on pretty much any of the arguments and parameters. A square bracket argument is mandatory?
Get-Help Get-Command -ShowWindow will output everything into a separate window 
GySgt's go to is get-help get-command -online, way more intuitive than past scripting languages
Get-Help *net* will show anything involving net in it. Gunny google will always be your friend
Powerhell also provides about pages, using get-help about_*, about_Script_blocks

Alias's
An alias is just a different name for something
User-defined and enviornmental. 
$alias:dir is Get-ChildItem
Get-Alias -Definition get-childitem
Don't use alias's too much it will waste time, and if you shorthand too much some people don't know
set-alias edit notepad.ese
set-alias <name of alias> <what it's running>
remove-item alias:edit
User-defined alias's are not persistent through shut downs, unless you use powershell profiles
Get-Alias will give you all the alias's

Object based
Every object has a characteristic and method, what it is and what it does
(Get-Process).ProcessName
(Get-Process -Name notepad).Kill()
Get-Process | Get-Member is how you get each type of property information
Get-Process is an array of information, using foreach and using a pipeline has pipeline variables
$_ is the pipeline variable 
Get-Service | Format-Table -Autosize or -wrap if you can't see everything
If you use fruit-host it goes straight to the host and that's it, if you want to have it be further 
manipulated by the pipeline use fruit-output. Fruit-host will not be sorted while fruit-output will
